# DCHerodome

## Project Description
DCHerodome is a React app for DC fans. It allows legendary fans to import their viewports based on DC superpowers. Fields contained by current DCEU market heroes will allow the user to navigate, acquire information, and compare reviews on the current abilities based on three(3) sources. Primarily used for the ongoing interest for this genre. Accompanying pages of recent depictions will be navigatable. 

## Primary Wireframe
With a header displaying title, and a logo floating above that will work as a "refresh", the user will be able to utilize five(5) forms to compare and test their returned inputs. "Current Line Container" will allow for one(1) input/received form for the CURRENT DCEU lineup with information displayed back. Overview Container will have one(1) input/received form that will use the table to showcase characterstics tailored from CLC. Compare Container will finalize our user(s) submissions with received inputs on who they choose.
