<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# DCHerodome

## Project Description

DCHerodome is a React app for DC fans. It allows legendary fans to import their viewports based on DC superpowers. Fields contained by current DCEU market heroes will allow the user to navigate, acquire information, and compare reviews on the current abilities based on three(3) sources. Primarily used for the ongoing interest for this genre. Accompanying pages of recent depictions will be navigatable.

## Primary Wireframe

With a header displaying title, and a logo floating above that will work as a "refresh", the user will be able to utilize five(5) forms to compare and test their returned inputs. "Current Line Container" will allow for one(1) input/received form for the CURRENT DCEU lineup with information displayed back. Overview Container will have one(1) input/received form that will use the table to showcase characterstics tailored from CLC. Compare Container will finalize our user(s) submissions with received inputs on who they choose.
